Subfolder Descriptions:
 
[Jupyter notebooks]: 
- Notebooks summarizing the auditing process for the applications in the manuscript
 
[Datasets]: 
- Original datasets (PPI, protein IDs, sequences, etc) for the three
PPI datasets in the study (Marcotte, Pan, and Vidal)
- Splits into training, validation and testing with and without redundancy reduction
- Generalizability assessment data
 
[Feature extraction]:
- Scripts to extract features for the frameworks in the study (M1-M7) 
- Scripts to randomize features for F1-F7 
*Note that some features are shared among multiple frameworks that utilize 
different ML models
 
[Features]:
- Original features for F3 
- Files necessary to extract remaining framework features
*Note: due to repository size limitations, the full feature files and 
randomized featuree files are not included in the repository and are 
available to download upon request.
 
[Functions]:
- Matlab functions necessary to run the scripts
- LibSVM-Matlab interfacing files for Mac64 and Linux64
 
[Paramters]:
- Summary of the parameter values used in model optimization and testing
 
[Results]:
- Result summary files
*Note: due to repository size limitations, the full result files are not 
included in the repository and are available to download upon request.
 
[1 Model optimization]:
- Scripts to optimize F1-F7 for datasets D1-D3
 
[2 Generalizability Auditor I]:  
- Scripts to test F1-F7 for D1 and F2 on independent examples from D3
       
[3 Feature Auditor]:
- Scripts to test the performance of F1-F7 on D1-D3 when protein features are randomized
         
[4 Node degree Auditor]:  
- Scripts to compare the original performance of F1-F7 for D1-D3 to the case when 
the models are trained on protein node degrees in training networks instead 
of protein sequence features
     
[5 Recurrence Auditor]: 
- Scripts to compare the original performance of F1-F7 for D1-D3 to the scoring 
function that maps protein node degrees to PPI probability 
        
[6 Debiasing Auditor]:   
- Scripts to compare the original performance of F1-F7 for D1-D3 to the case when 
the node degree bias is removed from training 
 
[7 Generalizability Auditor II]:
- Scripts to test F1-F7 for D1 and F2 on independent examples from D3 after 
the node degree bias is removed from training
