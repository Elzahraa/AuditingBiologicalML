To run all the experiments, you need to: 

(1) [Feature Extraction subfolder]: 
Extract features from raw sequences. 
Features are provided only for M3 due to repository size limitation.

(2) [1 Model optimization through 7 Generalizability Auditor II subfolders]: 
Go through the steps in order. 

Note: 
- You can follow a single framework (F1-F7) and dataset (D1-D3) without 
running all experiments for all frameworks and datasets.
- Feature extraction for M6 is extremely computationally expensive.
